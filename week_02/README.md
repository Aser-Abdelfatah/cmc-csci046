## Lecture

1. stacks
    1. in python, implemented using lists
    1. methods:
        1. `push`: add something on top; in python, we use the `append` method
        1. `pop`: take something off the top
    1. balanced parenthesis algorithm
    1. Reference: [textbook chapter 4](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/BasicDS/toctree.html)
        1. The textbook has their own library with a specially designed `Stack` object
        1. In the real python world, everyone just uses the `list` type for stacks,
           so that's what we'll use in this course

1. pytest library

1. runtime analysis
    1. big O/Omega/Theta notation
